# Fiction Social Auth

Fiction Social Auth is a social media authentication helper developed by Fiction Developers. For more information, visit [fictiondevelopers.com/auth-system](https://fictiondevelopers.com/auth-system).

We know the hurdle you have to go through to just manage the social media logins for your Flutter apps. You have to setup so many so many credentials on your developer account, later it's almost impossible to move it to client's accounts or to remember which project/account you used for configuration, and I know google doesn't allow that many projects to create. So just use this package get your job done under 5 minutes!


** Note: we don't keep user's data at all, everything is sent to your app and erased from our sessions instantly, so you don't have to worry about your privacy **
